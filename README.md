The GSoD journey to me is like Harry potter's journey to Hogwarts. A journey full of learnings (adventures) and challenges (hurdles), which I can not complete without the help of my mentors (friends) and Sphinx Documentation, Stack overflow, Google Search (spells).



 I would like to thanks my mentors - [Nathan Scott](https://github.com/natoscott), [Andreas Gerstmayr](https://github.com/andreasgerstmayr) and [Peter Portante](https://github.com/portante) for their constant support throughout the journey to mark it as 'Complete'.
